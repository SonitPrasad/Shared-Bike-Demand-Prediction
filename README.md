Data of shared bike demand on different occasion was used to develop a trained model XGBoost with R2- 0.95632.
With highest efficiency of the model, the data of future occasion was feed to get the predicted shared bike demand count.
Exploratory Data Analysis was performed on the data to understand the pattern in the demand of the shared bike
